Since then the charity has commissioned a sequence of outstanding, modestly-scaled buildings sited alongside NHS hospitals; many being designed by major architects, often without fee. A moving and sensitive portrayal of the inner life of the centres, this exhibition celebrates those who benefit from them – their gatherings, preoccupations, and individual journeys – and explores the essence of the buildings both spiritually and structurally.

Cooper creates work that possesses a strongly poetic and distinctive vision, and the artist has been described as a ‘magical realist’. An accomplished painter and printmaker, Cooper’s practice has always been underpinned by drawing. This remarkable body of work illustrates how her distinctive imagery has developed through making drawings that explore such subjects as sexuality, birth, family, fecundity and creativity. We are delighted to display, as part of the exhibition, the artist’s gift to the Royal Academy Collections of ten previously unseen mixed-media drawings. These feature Cooper’s iconic female figures, and are multi-layered and complex in form.</td><td>29 May — 23 August 2015</td><td>Royal Academy London</td><td><a target="_blank" href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/drawings-by-eileen-cooper">https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/drawings-by-eileen-cooper</a></td></tr><tr class="alt"><td>Summer Exhibition 2015 - </td><td width="100">Get ready to discover your new favourite artist as we head into a summer of colour at the RA.
